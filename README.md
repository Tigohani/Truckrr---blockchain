## Problem
Trucking is an industry rarely associated with cutting edge technology. Afterall, trucking is a relatively old industry, however, the old industries are the ones that need new technology the most. 700 billions dollars is added to the US economy every year from trucking alone. This figure is significant, but it is also riddled with problems. The industry as a whole is incredibly inefficient. Every year, more than 29 billion miles are traveled by trucks with either completely empty, or only partially full loads. This is ironic considering that the demand for trucking far outweighs the supply. The trucking system also favors larger companies, which is very problematic considering that 90% of trucking companies have fleets with fewer than 6 trucks. Additionally, at the front end, freight brokers make the entire process 20-30% more expensive without even solving any of the efficiency problems. All of these issues can be solved with our blockchain and IOT based solution called Truckrr. 

## Solution
Truckrr allows for the replacement of the middle man by allowing for more access. The key product is the access to a marketplace. Through the utilization of hyperledger, a blockchain based product, we allow for a decentralized atmosphere for trucking. This allows for people who need their product shipped to connect directly with the truck drivers rather than going through big trucking companies and brokers. This makes the consumer able to ship product faster and at far cheaper rates as they do not need to negotiate through a broker. Further since the truck driver does not have to go through a broker as well they make more money and are incentivized to stay on our app and continue making an increased profit. This creates an ecosystem where both the small business owner and these truck drivers are incentivized all while solving some of the industryâ€™s leading problems. No longer will there be empty or partially full loads as multiple small businesses can put their products all on one truck. This app will put the power all back into the individual. 

## Usage
- Git Clone this thing
- Open the XCWorkspace in Xcode
- Download the pods with 'pod install' inside the directory
- (If you want to test the hyperledger network then spin up a docker image of hyperledger and throw on the .bna file)
- View the hyperledger network inside hyperledger folder
